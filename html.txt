-The HTML tells the browser where and how to render the files received from a website

1. html5 introduced new elements like <video>,<audio>,<section>,<article>,ect...,
2. html5 introduced concept of semantic html.
3. html5 introduced the concept of media.
4. html5 introduced the concept of storage.

Why do we have to use html5?

-garbage rendering is called as quirks mode in browser language
-Doctype for html5 is <!DOCTYPE html>

Browser interprets the elements via two ways:

1.Block level elements: has dimensions
2.inline level elements:doesnt have dimensions-takes dimensions from the child elements

examples of block level elements :-
1.Body
2.div
3.section,article,header,footer

example of inline level elements :-
1.span
2.a
3.image

In html5 a new concept was introduced called 'trinity'
<article>
	<header></header>
	<section></section>
	<footer></footer>
</article>

<nav> navigation bar is present inside the header.

There are two ways of having lists in html:
1.ordered List
2.unordered list
the elements <ul> and <ol> can have only one child element that is <li>
